Version: 1.0.1
This project can help a primary school math teacher to assign homework to students and check students' homework easily. Clicking the single buttons several times, teachers
can finish their work more quickly.
Based on Python 3, the program can randomly create a series of math problems and corresponding answers. You can copy them or export them as a normal txt file as you like.
Everyone can use this project limitlessly.

Thanks to my teacher Liu Yong, who use this software and offer help for me to correct some of bugs in the program.


Version: 1.0.2
After a week's use, many errors of this software has been discovered. In this version, the error of showing answer after editing attributes has been corrected.What's more,
if you click one of the two export buttons by mistake, you can cancel the file choosing dialog beyond throwing an exception.I changed the window icon into an icon showing 
four characters------plus, substract, multiply and divide, which is a more corresponding icon for this software.
The icon is download from iconfont.cn.
