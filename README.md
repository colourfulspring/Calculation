I am a student study in University of Secience and Technology of China(USTC). This project is my first homework of the course, software engineering.
Now I can be described as knowing nothing about software engineering, including how to corporate with other software engineer, how to write an excellent OO program and
even how to write this README file.
This project can help a primary school math teacher to assign homework to students and check students' homework easily. Clicking the singal buttons several times, teachers
can finish their work more quickly.
Based on Python 3, the program can randomly create a series of math problems and corresponding answers. You can copy them or export them as a normal txt file as you like.
Everyone can use this project limitlessly by running callMainWin.py.
